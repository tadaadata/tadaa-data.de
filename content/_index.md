Hello everyone.  
Recently, Lukas broke our site by doing updates and not knowing about things that were affected by upgrades.  
It's a story as old as time â€“ and here we are.  

So while he's trying to get things set up again (faster, stronger, with a slight chance of lasting maybe a year longer or so), you are presented with this mildly embarrassing testament to the idea of "it can't be *that* hard to set up and maintain a [hugo](http://gohugo.io)/[blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) blog, what could possibly go wrong?"

Chances are you'r only looking for the [R-Intro](https://r-intro.tadaa-data.de) anyway. In which case: Consider your needs met.
