We're Tobi & Lukas, or Lukas & Tobi, or [@jemus42](https://twitter.com/jemus42) and [@Unsichtbarer](https://twitter.com/Unsichtbarer), or [MarauderPixie](https://github.com/MarauderPixie) and [jemus42](http://github.com/jemus42), or something like that.

Studying at [Uni Bremen](http://uni-bremen.de/), we realized that throwing code at data was a fun thing to do, and conveniently enough there seems to be a lot of that stuff flying around these days.

While we're finishing up our (now second) degrees, we dabble in a few projects here and there, and you might find them mentioned here.

Lukas has a [blog with the things and the stuff](https://blog.jemu.name) going, but he's still failing to convince Tobi that setting up a blog is a good idea.

## Projects

Here's a more-or-less complete list of our projects, both as a starting point for interested observers, and also as a reminder for ourselves so we don't forget about something we meant to get back to. Looking at you, [Zombology](https://zombology.tadaa-data.de).

### R-Packages

[**tadaatoolbox**](https://tadaatoolbox.tadaa-data.de/) ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tadaatoolbox) / [GitHub](https://github.com/tadaadata/tadaatoolbox)): Writte while we were still undergrads and needed / wanted some convenience tools to help with our activities as stats tutors and in minor projects we were doing. It's definitely not recommended for active use in the real world.

### Analysis Projects

- [Zombology](https://zombology.tadaa-data.de)
