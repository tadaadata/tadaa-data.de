We're people who like stats and R and also things and stuff.  

{{< figure src="/images/tobilukas.png" title="Because professional portraits would be silly" >}}

We're Tobi & Lukas, or Lukas & Tobi, or [@jemus42](https://twitter.com/jemus42) and [@Unsichtbarer](https://twitter.com/Unsichtbarer), or something like that.  

Studying at [Uni Bremen](http://uni-bremen.de/), we realized that throwing code at data was a fun thing to do, and conveniently enough there seems to be a demand for that kind of thing.  
While we're finishing up our degrees, we dabble in a few projects here and there, and you might find them mentioned here.

Lukas has a [blog with the things and the stuff](https://blog.jemu.name) going, but he's still failing to convince Tobi that setting up a blog is a good idea.

## Projects

Here's a more-or-less complete list of our projects, both as a starting point for interested observers, and also as a reminder for ourselves so we don't forget about something we meant to get back to. Looking at you, [Zombology](https://zombology.tadaa-data.de).

- [tadaatoolbox](https://tadaatoolbox.tadaa-data.de/) ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tadaatoolbox) / [GitHub](https://github.com/tadaadata/tadaatoolbox)) (sadly in need of a big overhaul)

### Teaching

## Infrastructure

While we're [on GitHub](https://github.com/tadaadata) for our open source projects, we also host our own private git server on [git.tadaa-data.de](https://git.tadaa-data.de) (via the wonderful [Gitea](https://gitea.io)) for our more sensitive and/or non-public-facing projects.
