We're people who like stats and R and also things and stuff.  

### Who?

<img src="/tobilukas.png" alt="Because professional profiles would be silly" width="75%"/>

We're Tobi & Lukas, or Lukas & Tobi, or [@jemus42](https://twitter.com/jemus42) and [@Unsichtbarer](https://twitter.com/Unsichtbarer), or something like that.  

Studying at [Uni Bremen](http://uni-bremen.de/), we realized that throwing code at data was a fun thing to do, and conveniently enough there seems to be a demand for that kind of thing.  
While we're finishing up our degrees, we dabble in a few projects here and there, and you might find them mentioned here.

Lukas has a [blog with the things and the stuff](https://blog.jemu.name) going, but he's still trying to convince Tobi that setting up a blog is a good idea.

### Projects

Here's a more-or-less complete list of our projects, both as a starting point for interested observers, and also as a reminder for ourselves so we don't forget about something we meant to get back to. Looking at you, [Zombology](https://zombology.tadaa-data.de).
