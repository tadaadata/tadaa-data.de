```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tadaatoolbox)
```

It's been a while since we talked about `tadaatoolbox`.  
Well, considering we don't talk about much at all and primarily just *do* things, that's not that big of a surprise.  
Anyway, the toolbox is still on CRAN, it's still in development, and there's still a lot of plans for the package.

First up I should mention that [we've been using a pkgdown site](http://tadaatoolbox.tadaa-data.de/) for documentation purposes, so if you want to take a look at what the package does, that's a better place to start than we could create with a blog post, since the documentation will update with the package in tandem, while blog posts will become outdated over time.
